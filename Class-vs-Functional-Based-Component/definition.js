// Definition:

// Class Based Component:
// These are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component or React.PureComponent.
// They have a render() method where you define the structure of your component's
// UI using JSX. Class components are used for components that need to manage state
// or have lifecycle methods.

// Functional Based Component:
// These are functions that return JSX. They are used for components that don't need
// to manage state or have lifecycle methods.
// Functional component provides usage of Hooks.

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

// Pros of Functional Based Component:

// 1. Simpler Syntax: Function components have a simpler syntax compared to class components.

// 2. Pure Functions: Function components are essentially pure functions, meaning they only
// depend on their input (props) to produce output (UI).

// 3. Hooks: Functional components provide usage of Hooks, which allow you to add state and
// lifecycle methods to your components.

// 4. Using Props in Function Components: Function components make extensive use of props to
// pass data from parent to child components.

/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

// Pros of Class Based Component:

// 1. Explicit State Management: Class components provide a clear and explicit way to manage
// component state using the this.state property.

// 2. Lifecycle Methods: Class components have access to a range of lifecycle methods such as
// componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
